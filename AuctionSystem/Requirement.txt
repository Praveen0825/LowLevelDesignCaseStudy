Problem Definition:
A company FooBar has hosted an Online Auction System where any User(seller) can sell an object through an auction.
Each auction has a lowest bid limit and the highest bid limit.
Any registered user(buyer) can participate in an auction and bid on the product. He/She can update this bid amount or withdraw from an auction until the auction is completed. There is a meager participation cost of Rs. x for participating in an auction.


The Seller is given 20% of the participation cost(x). Rest remains as commission for FooBar.


When the auction closes, show the winning bid using the highest unique bid.
For a seller, show the profit/loss. profit/loss = winning auction price + participation cost-share(no_of_bidders * 0.2 * participation cost) - an average of the lowest and highest bid limits
If there is no winner then the profit will only be from participation cost.


The program should take as input two or more auctions and a set of users participating in these. Multiple auctions can happen simultaneously.


Highest Unique bid definition:
For a set of users A, B, C, D, E, F participating in auction A1


A bids 50,
B bids 90,
C bids 100,
D bids 90,
E bids 70,
F bids 100
Here 70 is the highest unique bid, therefore E is the winner. If there is no highest unique bid by the end of the auction, there is no winner for the auction.


Bonus:
Upgrade the buyer to a preferred buyer if he has participated in more than 2 auctions in the past. And for choosing a winner, whenever there is a tie on the highest bid, preference should be given to the preferred buyer and if it's tied between multiple preferred buyers, fallback to the next highest bid.
The preferred buyer is across sellers on the platform.
Functionalities expected:
• Add Buyer(name)
• Add Seller(name)
• Create Auction(id, lowest bid limit, highest bid limit, partiticipation_cost, seller)
• Create/Update Bid(buyer, auction, amount)
• Withdraw bid(buyer, auction)
• Close auction and return winning bid
• Get profit/loss(seller, auction)
